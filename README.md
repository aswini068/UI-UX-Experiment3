# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To perform a heuristic evaluation and UX comparison of three competing food delivery apps — Swiggy, Zomato, and Uber Eats — and propose design improvements for better usability.

## Algorithm:
1. Select the three apps: Swiggy, Zomato, and Uber Eats.
2. Identify key user tasks such as placing an order, searching for restaurants, and tracking delivery.
3. Evaluate each app using Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
4. Record usability issues, severity ratings, and user feedback.
5. Compare the apps based on performance, navigation, and visual design.
6. Suggest UI/UX improvements based on findings.
7. Prepare a comparative report with metrics and recommendations.

## Output:
A detailed comparison of Swiggy, Zomato, and Uber Eats highlighting usability strengths and weaknesses, followed by recommended design improvements.
Summary of Findings:

## Result:
From the heuristic evaluation, Swiggy offers the best overall user experience with intuitive navigation and minimal errors. Zomato provides strong visuals but can improve on load speed and error prevention. Uber Eats maintains consistency but can enhance personalization and discoverability. Implementing the proposed improvements is expected to increase usability scores and user satisfaction across all platforms.
